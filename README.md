## [Rock Paper Scissors (Java)](https://github.com/tylermassie/school_java_rps_project)
Description: My final project for my Java 2 class. It required me to create a Rock, Paper, Scissor game that used resources like images and audio files. The images and sounds used were due to my own specific creative choices.

Demonstrates:
* Basic Java Competency
* Ability to create Graphic User Interfaces
* Using audio, images, and other media with Java programs.
